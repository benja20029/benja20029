I'm Benjamin, a Computer Engineering Student from Santiago, Chile.

I'm primarily interested in **Machine Learning Engineering**, in particular Deep Learning and Computer Vision, and I'm currently working as a Data Scientist Intern At
[**Fingo**](https://fingo.cl/).

I'm also interested in Software Engineering (mostly backend), the connection between Machine Learning and hardware, and the intersection between Machine Learning and other fields such as Psychology, 
Sociology, Physics, etc. I'm seeking opportunities to collaborate on projects that have a great impact on society and the environment.

Lastly, in my free time I like to see series (currently seeing the Bear), do artistic gymnastics, and play video games.
